# House_prediction_project
## House Price Prediction with Decision Tree Classifier
# Project Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a house price prediction project using a Decision Tree Classifier. The aim of this project was to build a machine learning model that can predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant attributes. This model can assist potential buyers, real estate professionals, and analysts in making informed decisions.

# Key Features
Data Collection & Preprocessing: Comprehensive dataset of house features and prices, including data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
# Feature Engineering: 
Techniques for creating and transforming features to enhance model performance.
# Model Training:
Implementation of the Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn.
# Model Evaluation: 
Assessment of model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and feature importance analysis.
# Visualization: 
Tools and techniques used for visualizing data and model results.
# Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with detailed code and explanations for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
src/: Python scripts with functions and classes for preprocessing data, training the model, and making predictions.
